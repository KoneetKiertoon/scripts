1: checkCdromDrive -- /usr/lib/freegeek_show_cd_drives

The output should contain reference to a CD ROM and possibly a
DVD ROM which should each show up as one of scd? or sg?.
If not, it is likely cabled or jumpered incorrectly.
NOTE: The CD ROM may not show up in BIOS. This is not a
problem.

2: p채ivit채 grub -- sudo apt-get install --reinstall grub-pc
Jos/kun t채m채 kysyy, mihin asennetaan, niin LEVYLLE!!! rasti ja OK. EI OSIOLLE.

3: checkNetwork -- ping something
4: checkCpuInfo -- grep 'model name' /proc/cpuinfo
grep 'cpu MHz' /proc/cpuinfo
grep 'bogomips' /proc/cpuinfo
cpufreq-info -l | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | sed -r -e 's/^/Maximum CPU MHz ; /' -e 's/([0-9]{3})$/.\1/'

cpu MHz or model number* should match what was written on the
label on the case. If it does not you must stop and figure out
why.

* For various AMD chips, the model name will differ from the
MHz.  The model number (e.g. "1800+") will be the rating off of
which you should determine the system's inclusion into a given
spec, and should therefore also be the number written on the
case tag.  Ask somebody what this means if these instructions
are not clear.

Make sure that this info fits within the specifications of the
box that you are building.

It is expected that the bogomips rating is close to twice the
cpu MHz rating, so we are sure that the cpu is not damaged.  If
the bogomips rating is low, call over your friendly build
instructor.

5: checkSound -- speaker-test -t wav -c2 -l1
6: checkIntelVideo -- lspci | egrep 'VGA.*82845' && echo video card BAD || echo video card OK
result should be video card OK (not BAD)
7: checkMemory -- free -m | egrep '^Mem' | awk '{print $2}'
result should be close to MEG amount of memory installed
8: checkVideoResolution -- xdpyinfo | grep dimen
result should be 1024x768 at LEAST
